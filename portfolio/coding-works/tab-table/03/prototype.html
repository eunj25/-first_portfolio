          <h1>Sea</h1>
          <p>
            A sea or oceans is a huge salt water from the Earth's surface to land in whole or in part. The frozen sea is also called drift ice. In general, it refers to oceans and wide seas, and if they are on land, such as the Caspian Sea or the Dead Sea, they are classified as seas. The sea occupied by the country is called the territorial sea.

          <h1>The blue color of the sea</h1>
          <p>
            The blue color of the sea is a result of light scattering. As the sun's light passes through the atmosphere, more light of shorter wavelengths is scattered, and it is this short-wavelength light that gives the ocean a blue color. If there is a lot of sand, coral, or fish in the sea, the sun's rays collide and the light of different wavelengths is scattered and the color of the seawater can be seen as various colors.

            The sea is the place where life was first born on Earth, and many living things such as plankton, algae, fish, mammals, reptiles, and crustaceans live. The ocean has been closely related to human life since ancient times. Korea, which is surrounded by the sea on three sides and has abundant fishery resources, has also been affected by climate and other innumerable amounts. A country without a sea is called a landlocked country, and a country without a sea is called an inland region (aka inland state).
